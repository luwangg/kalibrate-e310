About Kalibrate
===============

Kalibrate is a GSM signal detector and clock frequency offset calculator.
Clock accuracy and frequency offset is an important aspect of GSM and cellular
networks. Out-of-specification clock accuracy causes a number of network issues
such as inconsistent network detection by the handset, handover failure, and
poor data and voice call performance.

Original version of kalibrate (for use with USRP1):
  * http://ttsou.github.com/kalibrate-uhd/kal-v0.4.1.tar.bz2

Universal Hardware Driver (UHD):

Release Notes

The USRP2/N200/N210 is clocked at 100MHz and does not output fractional sample rates.

For USRP1, the original, non-UHD version of kalibrate is recommended.
